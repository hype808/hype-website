        <p>
            The Hawaii Youth Percussion Ensemble (HYPE) was incorporated in February 2014. We are a youth performance ensemble dedicated to working hard in the pursuit of excellence. Education is a big part of our focus within HYPE. Students engage in full percussion ensemble rehearsals, clinics with guest artists, Eurhythmics classes, private lesson instruction, and individual and small group practicing. Outreach opportunities are also being provided for our students to teach and pass on what they have learned to other student percussionists across Hawaii. Currently, HYPE has an ongoing residency with the Jarrett Middle School Band. We have also conducted a two-day residency at Lanai High & Elementary School in January 2015.</p>

        <p>
            HYPE is recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. All donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law. We are very eager to expand our organization. If there is an interest to play with HYPE as a student member, present a clinic as a professional, or provide us with an opportunity to perform for an event, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hawaiiyouthpercussionensemble@gmail.com">hawaiiyouthpercussionensemble@gmail.com.</a> HYPE looks forward to hearing from you!</p>

        <p>
            HYPE proudly endorses Vic Firth sticks and mallets.</p>
